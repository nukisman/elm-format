The benefits of `elm-format-short` are same as of `elm-format`:
 - It makes code **easier to write**, because you never have to worry about minor formatting concerns while powering out new code.
 - It makes code **easier to read**, because there are no longer distracting minor stylistic differences between different code bases. As such, your brain can map more efficiently from source to mental model.
 - It makes code **easier to maintain**, because you can no longer have diffs related only to formatting; every diff necessarily involves a material change.
 - It **saves your team time** debating how to format things, because there is a standard tool that formats everything the same way.
 - It **saves you time** because you don't have to nitpick over formatting details of your code.

 - It makes code **easier to navigate**, because you have not to scroll needless empty space by mouse or arrows on keyboard.
 - It makes code **easier to write**, because it is **easier to read** and **easier to navigate**.
 - It makes code **easier to debug**, because your lines of code commented out for debug purposes are not surrounded by needless blank lines above and below.
